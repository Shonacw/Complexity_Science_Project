**Imperial College London Physics Degree: Complexity Science Project**

Complex systems theory strives to address how global phenomena arise from local interactions between the many small components of a dynamical system. It provides an explanation for phenomena which fail to be described using classical laws, an example of which is the BakSneppen model which concerns the co-evolution of two species.

In this project an investigation the Oslo Model was undertaken as means of exploring Self Organised Criticality, a property inherent to all dynamical systems with a steady state attractor.

Please see my full project write-up [*A Demonstration of Self Organised Criticality:
The Oslo Model*](https://github.com/Shonacw/Complexity_Science_Project/blob/main/ShonaCurtisWalcott_ComplexityReport.pdf), and my accompanying code for the [*Oslo Model*](https://github.com/Shonacw/Complexity_Science_Project/blob/main/Complexity.py) and [*analysis*](https://github.com/Shonacw/Complexity_Science_Project/blob/main/Complexity_Run.py).
